# Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles

To plug the plugins, 
```console
./dotfiles_manager
```

The specs of the plugins are all tested.
To run the specs, you must install the latest version of RSpec and all related dependencies
```console
bundle install --path .bundle
```

After that, you can run
```console
bundle exec rspec
```
or 
```console
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```
